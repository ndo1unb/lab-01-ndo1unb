# Microservices Lab Questions

Please provide your answers to the following questions based on your experience and learning in the lab session.

## Understanding Microservices

1. What are the key differences between monolithic and microservices architectures? How do these differences impact application development and management? 
2. In your own words, explain the concept of a microservice and how it communicates within a microservices architecture.

## Spring Boot Implementation

1. Describe the steps you took to set up and run the *`AddService`* and *`SubtractService`* using Spring Boot. Were there any challenges you faced? 
2. How did you configure different ports for *`AddService`* and *`SubtractService`* in Spring Boot? Why is this necessary?

## Working with Microservices

1. Explain how you would scale the *`AddService`* independently of the *`SubtractService`*. What are the advantages of this ability in a microservices architecture? 
2. If one of the services (e.g., *`SubtractService`*) fails or becomes unavailable, what impact does this have on the other service (e.g., *`AddService`*)? How does this compare to a monolithic architecture?

##Reflection

1. Reflect on your experience of working with microservices in this lab. What did you find most challenging or interesting? 
2. Based on your experience, what are the potential benefits and drawbacks of using a microservices architecture for a real-world project?
