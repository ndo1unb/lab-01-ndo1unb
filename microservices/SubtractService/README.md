# Introduction to Microservices with Spring Boot

### What are Microservices?
Microservices are a software architecture style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Each microservice is a small, independent, and deployable module that focuses on a single functionality or business capability. This architecture promotes a decentralized approach to development, where each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Key Advantages of Microservices
- **Scalability**: Individual components can be scaled independently based on demand. 
- **Flexibility**: Microservices allow for using different technologies and languages as needed. 
- **Resilience**: The failure of a single service does not bring down the entire application. 
- **Ease of Deployment**: Smaller codebases and independent deployment make continuous delivery and deployment more manageable. 
- **Focused Teams**: Teams can focus on specific services that align closely with business capabilities.

### Challenges of Microservices

- **Complexity in Management**: The distributed nature of the architecture can lead to challenges in managing and monitoring the services. 
- **Network Latency**: Communication between services over a network can introduce latency. 
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency across services can be challenging. 
- **Service Integration Testing**: Testing the interactions between services can be more complex than in a monolithic architecture.

## Implementing Microservices with Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an ideal framework for building microservices due to its ease of use, simplicity, and convention-over-configuration philosophy. Here's how microservices are typically implemented using Spring Boot:

### Structure of a Spring Boot Microservice

- **Application Entry Point**: Each microservice has its own main application class annotated with @SpringBootApplication. 
- **Business Logic**: Services encapsulate their business logic, exposed via RESTful APIs or other means. 
- **Data Layer**: Microservices often interact with their database, either a unique instance per service or a shared database. 
- **Configuration**: Externalized configuration using application.properties or application.yml files. 
- **Dependencies**: Microservices include only the necessary dependencies, keeping them lightweight.

### Example: AddService and SubtractService
In this project, we have implemented two simple microservices, *`AddService`* and *`SubtractService`*, using Spring Boot. Each service provides basic arithmetic operations and is independently deployable, demonstrating the principles of microservices architecture.
