# Monolithic Architecture Lab Questions

Please provide your answers to the following questions based on your experience and learning in the lab session.

## Understanding Monolithic Architecture

1. In your own words, explain the concept of a monolithic architecture.


## Reflections on Monolithic Architecture
### Scalability and Maintainability:
1. Discuss the scalability and maintainability of the monolithic calculator application. How easy would it be to expand its functionality or maintain it over time?

### Suitability for Small Applications:
1. Do you think monolithic architecture is suitable for small-scale applications like the calculator? Why or why not?

## Comparing Architectures
### Monolithic vs. Layered Approach:
1. How do you think your experience would differ if the same calculator application were structured using a layered architecture instead of a monolithic one?
### Potential for Refactoring:
1. If you were to refactor the monolithic calculator application into a different architectural style (e.g., microservices), what changes would you anticipate needing to make?

## General Insights
### Key Takeaways:
1. What are your key takeaways about monolithic architecture from this exercise?

2. How would you apply these learnings to future software development projects?
