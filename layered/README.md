# Layered Architecture Exercise: Implementing from Pseudocode

## Overview
In this lab exercise, you will implement a Java application using a layered architecture based on provided pseudocode. This exercise will help you understand how to translate conceptual designs and pseudocode into a structured, layered application.

## Structure of the Project

The project is divided into two main layers:
1. **User Interface Layer (`CalculatorUI`)**: Manages user input and output. 
2. **Business Layer (`CalculatorService`)**: Handles the logic of deciding which arithmetic operation to perform. 
3. **Operations Layer (`CalculatorOperations`)**: Responsible for executing the actual arithmetic operations like add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Open the Project**:
   - Open the project in your IDE. 
   - Confirm that the project is properly set up for Java development.

## Implementation Tasks
### Develop Each Layer:
- Implement the *`CalculatorUI.java`* to interact with the user.  
- Develop *`CalculatorService.java`* to process user inputs and determine the required operations. 
- Code *`CalculatorOperations.java`* to perform the actual arithmetic computations.

## Running the Application

* **Compile and Execute**:
  * Build and run the application using your IDE's features or command-line tools.
* **Interact with the Application**:  
  * Use the user interface to input operations and view the results.

## Analysis and Reflection

### Reflect on the process of building a layered architecture:
* **Advantages**: Discuss the benefits you observed, such as ease of maintenance, scalability, and separation of concerns. 
* **Disadvantages**: Identify any challenges or limitations you encountered, such as complexity in managing layers or potential performance issues. 
 
Consider scenarios where a layered architecture is beneficial versus where an alternative architecture might be more suitable.

##  Submission

- **Commit Your Code**: Push your complete code, including any test cases, to the repository. 
- **Documentation**: Submit a document or file containing your analysis and reflections on the exercise.
